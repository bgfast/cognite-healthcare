## Plan Highlights

### How does this plan work?

OAP plans have an annual deductible, or set dollar amount you must pay before the insurance carrier begins paying for medical expenses.

After the deductible amount is met, you are responsible for the coinsurance, which is a percentage of the total cost for services, up to the out-of-pocket max, at which point the plan pays 100% of all costs.

You can see specialists at any time without needing a referral from your primary doctor.
