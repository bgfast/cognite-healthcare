## Plan Highlights

### How does this plan work?

HDHP plans have a high annual deductible, or set dollar amount you must pay before the insurance carrier begins paying for medical expenses.

After the deductible amount is met, you are responsible for the coinsurance, which is a percentage of the total cost for services, up to the out-of-pocket max, at which point the plan pays 100% of all costs.

Members of HSA plans are eligible for a tax-free Health Savings Account (HSA).
